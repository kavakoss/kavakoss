Welcome to **Kavakoss** â€” my little corner of the internet where I share cybersecurity projects, CTF write-ups, and random insights along the way.

This site serves as both a portfolio and a record of my learning part project showcase, part public notebook.

I hope you find something useful here, or at least interesting!

```c {lineNos=false}
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, Welcome to kavakoss!\n");

    // Welcome to my Portfolio Website!
    return 0;
}
