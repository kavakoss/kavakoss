Welcome to **Kavakoss**, my space for sharing cybersecurity projects, CTF write-ups, and personal insights.

I post about cybersecurity concepts, CTF solutions (write-ups), bug bounty findings, and my journey into Web3 development and security.
This site serves as my portfolio and a journal of what I learn along the way.
