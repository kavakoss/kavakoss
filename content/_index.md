Welcome to **Kavakoss** â€” my little corner of the internet where I share cybersecurity projects, CTF write-ups, and random insights along the way.

This site serves as both a portfolio and a record of my learning part project showcase, part public notebook.

I hope you find something useful here, or at least interesting!
