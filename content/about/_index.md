Iâ€™m a 3rd-year cybersecurity student at Binus University who enjoys diving into CTFs, bug bounty hunting, and exploring Web3 development.

Always looking to sharpen my skills and share what I pick up along the way through write-ups and projects.

**Fun fact:** Iâ€™m a bit addicted to typing tests ðŸ™ˆ

On monkeytype I once hit ~150 WPM in a short 15s runâ€¦

A side hobby that keeps my fingers busy when I should probably be doing something else..
