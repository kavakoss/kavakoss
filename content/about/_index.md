Hi, Iâ€™m Jason â€” a Cyber Security enthusiast and CTF player from Bina Nusantara University. I love exploring cryptography, web exploitation, and forensics through competitions and real-world projects.

I enjoy learning, breaking, and rebuilding systems securely & sharing my findings through write-ups, talks, and team collaborations.

**Fun fact:** Iâ€™m a bit addicted to typing tests ðŸ™ˆ

On monkeytype I once hit ~150 WPM in a short 15s runâ€¦

A side hobby that keeps my fingers busy when I should probably be doing something else..
