How I Found `jvdsn/crypto-attacks` Last Week?

I discovered the repo just last week and I’ve already been messing with it during my practice CTFs, it’s actually super handy.

Modular, well-commented, and full of real attack scripts (RSA, ECDSA, CBC padding oracles, lattice stuff, ACD, and more). Below I wrote up the exact quickstart steps I used, a few practical tips, and 5 CTF Challenges using this library.

---

## TL;DR — what I did last week

* Cloned the repo.s
* Ran a couple of example scripts to verify my environment.
* Used the RSA / ECDSA / CBC scripts on toy data, then plugged in real CTF parameters.
* Tweaked lattice params (`m`, `t`) a couple times until results popped.

---

## Folder map (how I browsed it)

* `attacks/` — main attack scripts (rsa, ec, cbc, acd, …)
* `shared/` — helpers and utilities
* `test/` — sample vectors / small tests
* README files inside folders often tell you which params to edit

---

## How I approach a new challenge (my workflow)

1. Identify which category the challenge belongs to (RSA / ECDSA / CBC / ACD / etc).
2. Open the matching folder in the repo and read the script comments. The bottom of many scripts shows an example block — replace those values with your challenge params.
3. If it’s a lattice attack, start with default `m`/`t`, then iterate: increase `m` or `t` if no luck.
4. Add `print()` for debugging or to inspect intermediate lattice matrices.
5. Keep backups of original scripts before editing.

## Practical tips I picked up

* Read inline comments: the author often documents required bounds and parameters.
* Test on small numbers first: to confirm environment is correct.
* Parameter tuning: for lattice/Coppersmith attacks.

# CTF Challenge: "Secret Session Cookie Slip"

## Story / Description

You stumbled onto a sleepy web app called **ClipBoarder** — a tiny note service where users can save short snippets. The devs were in a hurry and used **AES-CBC** to encrypt session cookies. When you tinker with the cookie and resend it, the server answers differently depending on whether the padding was valid or not: one response says *"Invalid padding!"*, while another says *"Decryption error!"*. That’s a padding oracle.

The app gave you an encrypted session cookie. Your goal is to recover the plaintext session (it contains a `FLAG{...}` token) by exploiting the padding oracle.

## Final notes — my honest take

I found the repo last week and honestly I was surprised how quickly I could run example scripts end-to-end. It’s not magic — you still need to understand the math — but the repo saved me a ton of boilerplate, especially for lattice/Coppersmith experiments.
